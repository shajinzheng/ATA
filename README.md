# ATA - Dartmouth COSC 061 Final Project  
1. I designed, implemented, loaded, and tested a database to manage customers and their reservations, flights and their status, 
seat assignments on various flights, and the schedule and routing of individual flights;  
2. I also used PHP and HTML to build a web-based interface and front-end to the database;
3. This interface has the ability for 
  * a customer to book or cancel a flight, and to retrieve a list of past and upcoming reservations;
  * assigning the customer a seat on a flight when he/she books it;
  * freeing up the seat if the trip is cancelled, and disallowing the booking if the flight is full;
  * a ATA employee to retrieve the passenger list of a past or upcoming flight, and to gather statistics on popular routes flown within a given date range;
